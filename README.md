##Domain Knowledge

###Angular Directive: 
```
What directives actually are under the hood is simply JavaScript functions that manipulate and add behaviors to HTML DOM elements.

A main advantage of the directive, in addition to being intuitive-looking as its declarative aspect resides inline in your markup, is that it's a reusable component.

Regular declarative markup (regular HTML) can be mixed and matched in many ways to construct arbitrarily complex web pages. The behavior of those elements is configurable via attributes. Similarly, your custom declarative markup can be mixed and matched to construct your complex web application. This is more maintainable because the reuse of components cuts down the overall amount of code and centralizes and standardizes the logic of your app.

###Angular.js vs React
```
								Angular							React
Age                         	6 yrs    						2 yrs
Extensibility                   yes								yes
speed  							1.35s 							310ms
DOM 							browser		  virtual; only renders changed data
Architecture					full MVC				just View component
Structure + Components       HTML, JS, CSS	  same; can combine HTML & JS - JSX

Angular's Verdict: more powerful, feature packed b/c of full MVC architecture, age, and community, but suffers small performance hit

React's Verdict: lightweight and features virtual DOM; lightning fast for web apps that render large amounts of data but only contains View component - you need to provide own controller and model
