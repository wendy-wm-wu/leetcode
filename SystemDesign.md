## System Design

### Scalability 

- Vertical scaling: If you're running low on RAM or exhausting available CPU cycles or running low on disc place, get more RAM, more processor, more disc space. 
	- Cons: real-world constraints, financial resources, state of the art technology 
- Horizontal scaling
- Caching
- Load balancing
- Database replication
- Database partitioning
